	PROMS is a webbased project management system whose primary goal is to
	provide a facility for developers to communicate amongst other 
	developers, communicating things to end-users as well as getting feed-
	back from users (in the form of bugs, etc) and as a placeholder for
	project information.

1. About PROMS

	PROMS, which stands for Project Management System, is a webbased 
	application which focuses on the management of projects. It's main focus
	is to provide a facility for developers to communicate with other 
	developers and for them to exchange information with end-users.

	A good way of describing PROMS would be 'a combination of Freshmeat and
	SourceForge'.  It provides features for communicating and maintaining
	projects, releases, bugs, forums, files and todo's.
	
	At the moment, PROMS is mostly oriented towards small projects with 
	just a handfull of developers. Therefor things like e-mail notification
	are not really tweaked towards many developers on a single project. 


1.2. Current features.

	PROMS currently includes these features:
	
	* Projects
	* Project parts
	* Bugs / Bugtracker)
	* Todos
	* Files
	* Releases (including subscriber notifications)
	* General discussions
	* Bug discussions
	* Todo discussions
	* User management (including per-user restrictions/rights)
	* User manual (semi-context sensitive)
	* E-mail notifications of changes for most of the above features
	
	For a full list of all features accompanied by descriptions, please refer
	to the website. 
	
	PROMS is currently under development, and it is not recommended for daily
	usage. (Though it has never deleted any of my personal project stuff)
	
2. Installation

2.1. Requirements

	Serverside requirements:
		* PHP 4.x (might work under 3.x)
		* MySQL 3.x or greater.

	Clientside requirements:
		* Javascript enabled browser (only basic javascript like window.open 
		  and navigation.back)
		* CSS2 (will work without, but looks horrible)

	Developed and tested using:
		* Mozilla Firebird 0.6 - 1.0 / Internet Explorer 5/6
		* Apache 1.3.26
		* PHP 4.1.2
		* MySQL 3.23.49
		
2.2. Installation / Upgrade

	2.2.1. Automated installation / Upgrade
	
	Since version 0.9, PROMS contains an automated installer. This installer
	will guide you through the setup step by step. It will create a database
	for you and set up and install the sourcecode for you if you provide it
	with some basic information. It can also upgrade your version of PROMS from
	any version to the current version. 

	You can start the installer by executing the   setup.sh   script. If you
	follow the instructions on the screen you should be just fine. 

	The setup script can be run in two ways:

	[root@localhost] ~# chmod 755 setup.sh; ./setup.sh

	or

	[root@localhost] ~# sh ./setup.sh


	Please remember that the setup script is a beta (just like the rest of
	PROMS at this time). It might screw up your database. The setup script
	creates a backup of your database before upgrading, or at least it tries.
	If anything goes wrong, you should be able to put the old database back
	using this backup.
	
	NOTICES: 
		Please make sure you have have Magic Quotes enabled in your
		installation of PHP. If you do not have this enabled, your installation
		of PROMS will be VULNERABLE to SQL INJECTIONS!

		PROMS requires that the 'short_open_tag' be set to 'on' in the php.ini
		configuration.

		If you are running a different web server than Apache, please use your
		web server's configuration to prevent people from running scripts in 
		the files/ directory! If you do not, people might be able to upload PHP
		or PERL files and execute from within PROMS, which opens up major
		security holes.

	2.2.2. Manual installation / Upgrade

	If, for some reason, the automated installer does not work for you, you can
	install PROMS manually. (Please report any problems with the automated 
	installer!). 

	To install a completely new version, follow these steps:

	1. Create a new MySQL database.
	2. Import the file sql/proms.sql into the database:
	   [todsah@sharky]~$ mysql -u todsah -p [databasename] < sql/proms.sql
	3. Create a new user for the database:
	   mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON [databasename].* TO proms@localhost 
       IDENTIFIED BY '[password]';
	4. Change the defines in the src/settings.php file to match with the 
	   database and user names. Also change the other settings to your liking.
	   Remove the 'REF00#_' from each of the defines so that the lines look 
	   like this: : define ("DB_DATABASE", "proms");

	   ! Make sure you set the PROMS_VERSION variable to the correct version.
	5. Copy all .php files in the src/ directory to your webserver directory.
	6. Point your browser to the proms.php page.
	7. Register a new account for yourself. The first account registered will
	   be the administrator account whom can do anything he damn well pleases.
	   

	To upgrade a current version:

	1. Run the scripts in the sql/ directory. You should check your current
	   version of PROMS and run each script with a version number equal to, or
	   higher than, your current version. Running the scripts can be done 
	   with the following command:

	   mysql -uUSERNAME -pPASSWORD -hHOSTNAME DATABASENAME < sql/0.8.sql

	   Of course you must replace USERNAME et al with the username of a mysql-
	   account which is allowed to create/mod tables and such.
	2. Change the defines in the src/settings.php file to match with the
	   database and usernames. Also check all other settings and set them to
	   their appropriate values (shouldn't be too difficult).
	3. Copy src/* to the destination path.
	

	NOTICES: 
		Please make sure you have have Magic Quotes enabled in your
		installation of PHP. If you do not have this enabled, your installation
		of PROMS will be VULNERABLE to SQL INJECTIONS!

		PROMS requires that the 'short_open_tag' be set to 'on' in the php.ini
		configuration.

		If you are running a different web server than Apache, please use your
		web server's configuration to prevent people from running scripts in 
		the files/ directory! If you do not, people might be able to upload PHP
		or PERL files and execute from within PROMS, which opens up major
		security holes.
	
2.3. Configuring

	At the moment, PROMS does not have a global configuration module which can
	be accessed from the application itself. If you wish to change any of the
	global settings, you'll have to change them manually in the 'settings.php'
	file. 

	Some future version of PROMS will include a global configuration module. Or
	not.

	Certain information lacks an interface. For instance, bug priorities and
	licenses. Hopefully, I'll get around to implementing these sometime in the
	future, but don't count on it. 

2.4. Setting up the noreply PROMS e-mail address

	PROMS sends out e-mails about new releases, bugs, todo's and forum replies
	to users so they know what's going on with the project. In order to protect
	the users' email addresses, the recipients are specified in the BCC field.
	PROMS requires an email address that it can put in the To: field, which
	will also be used as a return email address. This email address does not
	necessarily have to end up anywhere, mail sent to the email address can be
	saifly deleted.

	By default PROMS suggest the 'noreply@yourhostname.tld' email address. If
	you are running Exim, you can add the following entry to your /etc/aliases
	to tell Exim it can throw emails to that address away:

	noreply: :blackhole:

	For other SMTP daemons, please check their documentation.

3. Feedback / Contributing.

	If you wish to contribute to PROMS, please read this section. It contains
	rules and guidelines for contribution. Since this is a very small project,
	I'm very picky about who and what I allow to be contributed. 

3.1. Feedback (bugs/questions/feature requests)

	If you've got feedback about PROMS, and wish to share it, you can do so
	in a couple of ways.

	1. Send email to <%%EMAIL>
	2. Use a 'beta' version of PROMS to give me your feedback. You can find it
	   at http://projects.electricmonk.nl/index.php?action=ProjectOverview&project_id=2
	
	I'd prefer it if you'd use 2.

	When giving feedback, please keep these following rules in mind:

	* Be on topic. This means that you should read sections 1 and 4 of this 
	  README file so you know what this project is all about. I don't want to
	  recieve feature-requests asking if I can implement an intergrated e-mail
	  client, if you know what I mean.
	* Be specific. If you've found a bug or have a feature request, please
	  provide the URL where you've found the bug or want the feature. Try to be
	  short but clear.
	* If you're going to report a bug, please follow the standard bug-reporting
	  guidelines. You can find a good guide to reporting bugs here:
	  http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html

3.2. Contributing

	If you wish to contribute to this project, you'll have to come up with a
	pretty damn good contribution. This is quite a small project, and we'd have
	a better chance of completing it by just working on it by the two of us
	than with 120 developers. What kind of contributions are we interested in? 

	* Bug-fixing patches.
	* Bug-fixing patches.
	* I'd like some bug-fixing patches.
	* Feature enhancements. (Please note the 'enhancement' part.. it means I'd
	  like enhancements to currently available features).
	
	Completely new features might get accepted, but don't count on it. The best
	way to go here is to first tell me about your idea. I will then let you know
	if it's any good for inclusion in PROMS. If not, don't be sad.. I'm just a
	bit too focussed on project-goals and believe in the Keep It Simple Stupid
	principle.

	If you contribute a completely new module, I might include it in the PROMS
	distribution or provide an additional download on the website for the 
	module. That way, people can still use the module but we don't have to 
	provide support for it. Integration with current PROMS code will be 
	difficult though. 

	3.2.1. Writing patches/contributions.

	There are, at the moment, no official coding guidelines. Just look at the
	other sources to get an impression about code-style, layout, used functions,
	etc. Also take a long good hard indepth look at inc_common.php, for it 
	contains functions which you should use.

	Some rules you should follow are:
	* Create patches using: diff -ruN [latest-release] [your-changes]
	  Run it in the directory which CONTAINS the proms/ directory.
	* If you can, use the following editor settings:
	  - Vim: 
		:set tabstop=4
		:set softtabstop=4
		:set shiftwidth=4
		:set noexpandtab
		:set guioptions-=T
	  - Other editors:
		Tabs should be tabs, not just a couple of spaces.
		Only use tabs at the start of a line. Use spaces eveywhere else 
		(aligning).

3.3. Credits

	My thanks goes out to the following people, who have helped in the
	development of PROMS in some way or another:

	Michiel van Baak: Todo implementation. Various patches.
	Marco Lopes: Bug-fixing patches and testing.
	Justin Palmer: Basis for the bbcode function.


4. Roadmap

	So, where's this project going?

	NOTE: This is here mostly for historical reasons. 

	[x] Release 0.7 will focus on: 
		More feature completions,
		Bug tracking capabilities which will allow users to see the history of bugs,
		Todo tracking capabilities which will aloow users to see the history of todo items***.
		
		***) This item has been scratched from the roadmap. It is useless.

	[x] Release 0.8 will focus on:
		Documentation,
		Additional features,
		Security fixes,
		Bug fixes,
		Code cleanups,
		User interface fixes,

	[x] Release 0.9 will focus on,
		Additional features,
		Security fixes,
		Bug fixes,
		Code cleanups.

	[x] Release 0.10 will focus on,
		Bug fixes,
		Security fixes,

	[x] Release 0.11 will focus on,
		Additional features,
		Bug fixes
		
	Release 1.0 will rule.


	There will be two Release Candidates for version 1.0
	

	These are, of course, just guidelines. Efforts may at any time stray from
	above path.
